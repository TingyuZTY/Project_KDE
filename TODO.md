(Week 5)      1. Estimation. Write the estimation function that can give the kernel denstity esitmates for a given kernel density and some type of bandwidth. 

(Week 5 & 6)  2. Correctness. Generate several samples under different densities, and check the correctness or the performance of the estimation function by calculating the 'Mean Absolute Deviation Errors' or via plots. 

(Week 6)      3. Inspection about the sample size and kernel density. Compare the performance under different sample sizes and different choices of kernel densities. 

(Week 7)      4. Inspection about the bandwidth. Compare the performance under different methods of selecting the bandwidth. 

(Week 8)      5. Apply this method to a real dataset.

(Week 9 & 10) 6. Report and Presentation.
